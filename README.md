# soilMicrobiome
project assessing the differences in community structure and function for soil microbes across NEON sites

includes scripts for:
- accessing the MG-RAST API
- converting abundance tables into community matrices
- calculating metrics of diversity
- calculating metrics for dissimilarity and distance across sites

as well as the structural and functional data across the NEON sites, a shiny app for displaying alpha diversity (along with .css and .js scripts for mapping aesthetics), and a final markdown that brings all of these together
